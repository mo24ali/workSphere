##  About

WorkSphere is an innovative web application designed for visual and interactive management of personnel within office spaces.  
It allows real-time organization and allocation of employees on a floor plan while respecting role-based constraints and authorized zones.

### Main Objectives
- Add, move, and remove employees directly through a graphical interface representing the workspace.  
- Enforce business rules: each employee can only be positioned in zones allowed for their role (e.g., only receptionists can occupy the reception desk).  
- Provide a smooth, intuitive, and responsive user experience accessible on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- Centralize personnel data management and spatial visualization within a single platform.
It is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with a simple folder structure allowing for rapid deployment via GitHub Pages.  
Hosted (if applicable) at: [https://mo24ali.github.io/workSphere/](https://mo24ali.github.io/workSphere/)  

##  Features

- Browser‑based: no server required (static deployment).  
- Responsive layout (works on both desktop & mobile).  
- Organized assets folder for JS, CSS, and images.  
- Easy to customise (just edit the HTML/JS files).  
- Drag‑and‑drop

##  Tech Stack

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript   
- Hosted using GitHub Pages
